# TY for being here

> I'm terrible at writing letters. Like really terrible.

Hey, I'm Rıza. I'm now 19.  
And for some reason, that number feels... heavier than I expected.

This little event, this little letter — it's all my way of saying  
"thank you" to everyone who's been around, even silently.

So, a bit about me...  
I've spent the last few years figuring out who I am and what I want.  
From coding late into the night to learning new things every day—it's been a ride.

There have been ups, downs, and all-around weird moments.  
But here I am, still learning, still growing, and somehow, still not sure what I'm doing with my life.  
But I guess that's okay, right...? riiight...? 😅

## My thoughts about the future

- I’m thinking about getting a drawing tablet and trying my hand at some art. (If I don’t break it during a heated osu session, of course 😁)
- I also want to learn how to create music. I’ve always loved indie game soundtracks
- I manage to juggle all these, then... who knows? Maybe making a game will be the next step.
- But first, I still need to figure out how to make some money 🥲

Anyway... I would love to "I'm live on twitch/yt/kick rn" but my pc doesn't let me.

import { Text } from "@mantine/core";

Now I just want to say

<Text ta="center" fz={53}>
    THANK YOU SO MUCH GUYS! <br />
    ILY ALL {"<3"}
</Text>
